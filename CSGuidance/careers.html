<h1>Careers</h1>
<p class="style-paragraph">While coding is certainly an important aspect of many computer science careers, it is far from the only thing
   that matters. In fact, many CS careers require a broad range of skills beyond just programming,
   including problem-solving, critical thinking, project management, and communication. For example, roles
   like UX/UI design, cybersecurity, data analysis, and artificial intelligence all require a strong technical
   foundation in computer science, but also demand skills that are more interdisciplinary. Therefore, those who
   are interested in pursuing a career in computer science should be prepared to develop a diverse skill set that
    goes beyond just coding.

              They work with large and complex datasets and use various tools and algorithms to analyze the data and uncover
              hidden patterns, correlations, and trends. The insights and findings from this analysis can be used to inform
              business decisions,
               product development, or support scientific research.</p>

            <p>An Artificial Intelligence Engineer is a professional who designs and develops artificial intelligence
              (AI) systems and solutions. They work on creating algorithms and models that allow computers to perform
              tasks that would normally require human intelligence, such as speech recognition, image classification,
              and natural language processing. An AI Engineer is responsible for developing, testing, and deploying
              these AI systems and ensuring their performance, scalability, and reliability. They also work closely
              with data scientists, software engineers, and other specialists to integrate AI technologies into
              existing systems and applications. The goal of an AI Engineer is to make human-like intelligence
              available to machines, allowing them to perform tasks that would normally require human intuition,
               decision making, and problem solving.</p>
