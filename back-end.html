      <h1>Back End</h1>
      <p class="style-paragraph">The back end is like the "brain" of a website or application that works behind the scenes to make
        everything work. It is what makes it possible for users to interact with the front end and get the
        information they need.</p>

              <p>Java is a programming language used frequently in the back end.It is reliable and easy to use for testing which is very desirable when working
                with databases.It has also been around for a long time which makes it a tried and tested reliable language.It is also scalable which means
                it is easy to build large applications for big companies.You're  typical java code will look like the following:<br>
                <span ><pre><code class="code-example">
                  public static void main(String[] args) {
                    System.out.println("Hello world");
                  }
                </code></pre></span>
                This line of code will print "Hello world", much like javascript it has it's own syntax and semantics that
               decides how you do something!

              <p> frameworks are a set of guidelines or rules that provide a structure for building software
                applications. It provides a pre-defined way of doing things, which makes it easier for developers
                to build complex systems by providing a common set of abstractions, tools, and libraries.
                For example, Spring is a framework for building Java applications.
                It provides a number of pre-built components that handle common tasks, such as connecting to
                databases, handling security, and managing user interface components. </p>

              <p>A database is a collection of organized data stored in a structured way, such as in tables, columns, and rows.
                It is designed to store data efficiently and make it easy to search, sort, and retrieve the data when needed.
               A Database Management System (DBMS) is the software that interacts with end users, applications, and the
               database itself to capture and analyze the data. It provides an interface to perform various operations on
               the database, such as inserting, updating, and retrieving data.
               The DBMS also ensures the integrity and security of the data, and helps in managing the overall performance of
                the database.</p>
