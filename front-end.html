    <h1>Front-End Development</h1>
    <p class="style-paragraph">When referring to front-end development you are referring to the "face" of an application or website,
      it is what an average user will see and interact with.This means handling the user interface,buttons, and
      any  additional animations or visuals that the user will see.A typical front-end dev will need a good eye to
      make the front-end visually appealing and user friendly, you can expect them to be familiar with tools such
      as HTML,CSS, and javascript.

          <p>HTML stands for hypertext markup language, just as the name suggest it is a markup language used to format and structure
            a webpage.HTML will be used for creating your headers,paragraphs, as well as any meta data that you want to include for your page.
            Having a good understanding of HTML allows a developer to build upon the foundation and be creative!
            <br> your typical HTML will look something like this: <br><span ><pre><code class="code-example">   &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
            &lt;html&gt;
            &lt;body&gt;

            &lt;h1&gt;My First Heading&lt;/h1&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;My first paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/body&gt;
            &lt;/html&gt;  </code></pre></span>
            this html snippet will create a header titled "My First Heading" and a paragraph with "My first paragraph" inside!
          </p>

        <div class="accordion-item-body">
        <div class="accordion-item-body-content">
          <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, it is a styling language that developers use to make their apps or sites look a certain way,
            CSS can do many things such as changing the colors, the layout of your page, you can even add animations to your site!
            Your typical css will look something like this:
            <span "><pre><code class="code-example">body {
              background-color: lightgray;
              font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
            }

            h1 {
              color: blue;
              text-align: center;
            }

            p {
              font-size: 14px;
              line-height: 1.5;
              padding: 10px;
            }</code></pre></span>
            while this might look complicated, all it is doing is chaing the background color of an element named "body" to light gray, as
            well as changing the properties of elements called "h1" and "p".

          Javascript

        <div class="accordion-item-body">
        <div class="accordion-item-body-content">
          <p>Lets say you wanted to add some functionality to your site or maybe some more complex animations or interactions.
             For this, you would use a programming language such as javascript for additional functionalities to your site. Javascript is an actual programming language which means it will be a bit more complicated to pick up. Although it is complicated, that means it is more powerful and you can do things such as dropdown menus, data validation, and even something like interactive maps. Below you will see a preview of javascript:</p1>
            <span ><pre><code class="code-example">console.log("Hello, World!");</code></pre></span>
            <p1>while this might look simple, this is just for a simple program that prints "Hello, World!", it is only the
              beginning of what you can do with this tool in your belt.
